      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/botmod">Cecil's Bot Mod</a></li>

      <p>Perhaps the only thing I should be proud of this year even if I'm not working on any new updates as usual. I've always wanted bots in Serious Sam because barely anyone would play multiplayer with me, especially in my own mods. And it's also nice to have a full control over their behaviour. It started as a part of the <q>SE Sandbox</q> mod based on Serious Engine 1.10 in 2018, alongside the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kixI0bWMmdQ">sandbox mode</a>.</p>

      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/hl2-im">Half-Life 2 Immersion Mod</a></li>

      <p>Other than implementing my bots into this mod, I also made it <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/HL2IM">open-source</a> in case someone wants to take a peek at the horrible 3-year old codebase. No major updates.</p>

      <li>Serious Sam Evolution</li>

      <p>You may not believe this but SSE project is still alive and kicking. More than ever, actually. I was involved in it a significant portion of this year, contributing numerous ideas and even features, such as extra brush polygon layers for Nitro Family map support and for general usage. Make sure to follow our <a href="https://twitter.com/ssevolutiongame">development Twitter account</a> to get updates on the project as they come.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/AdvancedMultiplayer2">Advanced Multiplayer 2</a></li>

      <p>This project is in a weird state since last year, mostly because of my incompetence in implementing certain features, the bugs of which keep popping up. I cannot release a buggy version, yet I don't feel working on the bugs because they're all related to the horrible networking that Serious Engine 1.07 has to offer.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/TinyEntityPack">Tiny Entity Pack</a></li>

      <p>A small random collection of entities for Serious Sam v1.07 that were made as a request. I was thinking of updating it but no one found much use of it ever since the first version. Maybe I could merge it with an improved <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/726537272874237962/758430390762471495/EntityReplacementPack_20200923.zip">Entity Replacement Pack(tm)</a> from last year. Who knows.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/LilacDragonScript">Lilac Dragon Script</a></li>

      <p>In early 2020 an attempt was made in creating my own scripting language as a part of some Sam project and detached from it in 2021. It takes roots from <a href="https://yal.cc/interpreters-guide/">YellowAfterlife's tutorials on interpreters</a>, written on GameMaker Language. It was a tough challenge translating it from GML to C++ and adding my own features but it somehow worked. Not without long-term bugs that seem impossible to fix now. So I put this one on ice until I can figure out how to rework it in a better manner. It had so much potential...</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le0t6XGKDaQ">Here's a little demo using this scripting language within Serious Sam through an entity pack.</a></p>
