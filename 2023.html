      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/classics-patch">Serious Sam Classics Patch</a></li>

      <p>Haven't stop working on this project since last year. This time it has received some very major updates, most notably the ability to play The First Encounter and Revolution levels (including workshop) through The Second Encounter. But that's only the tip of the iceberg. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/SamClassicPatch/SuperProject/releases/tag/1.7.1">latest 1.7.1 patch</a> that I've released for this Holiday season!</p>

      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/botmod">Cecil's Bot Mod</a></li>

      <p>Bots have received two small updates this year, the latest being <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/CecilBotMod/releases/tag/0.2.3">beta 0.2.3</a>. And yes, I'm getting rid of the "Early Access" label because it's not really applicable here. When I released them for the first time, I thought of them as being in their early unfinished stage. And they are still far from perfect but it's not like there's an ultimate final goal that I'm trying to reach. I wanted to work on the bots more this year, with version 0.2.4 being right around the corner but I've hit a few road blocks on my way there.</p>

      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/bright-island">Bright Island Classic</a></li>

      <p>Released a 1.1 update to this port that fixes some critical issues.</p>

      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/small-projects">NoCD Patch for b1.50</a></li>

      <p>Right after New Year 2023 celebration I made a NoCD patch for Beta 1.50 version of The Second Encounter. It's a part of my reverse-engineering adventure and you can find it among my "Small Serious Sam Projects".</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-ModSDK">Serious Sam SDK</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-ECC">Entity Class Compiler</a></li>

      <p>There have been numerous improvements to the SDK throughout the year, most of it thanks to Classics Patch that I basically developed in parallel with this SDK. The most major update to it is the near-perfect recreation of <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-ModSDK/tree/includes/EngineRev">headers for Serious Sam Revolution engine</a>. That's right, you can make your own mods for Revolution now. In fact, these headers match so well that I've even been able to build almost the entirety of Classics Patch for Revolution. Like Mr. Howard once said: "It just works!"</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/Serious-Engine">Serious Engine 1 fork</a></li>

      <p>Another interesting project I've been working on is my own Serious Engine fork. The purpose of this fork is to simply clean up 1.10 project files, as well as create a solid base for any kind of Serious Engine 1 project, including but not limited to: 64-bit OS support. Keep an eye on the releases that compile all of the commits into themed groups. Also check out <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/Serious-Engine/wiki">this repository's wiki</a>, which contains useful information about Serious Engine as a whole.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-Examples">Serious Engine 1 Examples</a></li>

      <p>This is my last experimental project of the year where I'm trying to come up with various tutorials on how to design and implement specific features for Serious Sam mods. It only has three examples so far, but feel free to suggest more. <a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-Examples/wiki">Check out the wiki</a> for the detailed tutorials on each repository branch.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Programming</h1>

    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SamModLauncher">Serious Sam Mod Launcher</a></li>

      <p>Gone are the days when you had to create batch scripts for each and every mod for launching the game or the editor for them. With this simple utility you can launch any game executable with the mod by simply naming it after the desired executable. It even works with custom Bin folders!</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SeriousSkaConverter">Serious SKA Converter</a></li>

      <p>This is a console utility for converting between different ASCII model formats, the main format being ASCII SKA models for Serious Engine 1. I made it before 2023 for the sole purpose of easily converting SMD models from Source games into Serious Sam. It works quite nicely but I haven't released it publicly until this year.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-Injector">Serious Engine 1 Injector</a></li>

      <p>A library that can replace any of the supporting DLL files used by games on Serious Engine 1 for injecting your own code into them. Simple but very effective.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-StaticLibrariesForGames">Static libraries from Serious Engine 1 games</a></li>

      <p>I've been really involved in reverse-engineering of Serious Engine 1 games. But how do you even begin making SDK for them? By linking its libraries, of course. So this is a collection of static libraries (and lists of their symbols) from ALL games on various versions of Serious Engine 1 that I could find. Have fun with them.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/DreamyUtilities">Dreamy Utilities</a></li>

      <p>Still working on it but still without a concrete new release version. It served me well though.</p>

      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/neuro-wants-a-cookie">Oh no! Neuro wants a cookie!</a></li>

      <p>As the very last thing of the year I made a game for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/neurosama-birthday-game-jam">Neuro-sama Birthday Game Jam</a>. Sadly, I didn't have enough time to implement my full idea but I still count it as a success. Plus it's my very first publicly released game made with Godot. An achievement, for sure.</p>
