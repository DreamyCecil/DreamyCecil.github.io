    <p>Added a <a href="/art">new page with my art archive</a> as to not lose the posts across many different platforms. It also includes some pieces that aren't posted anywhere.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://dreamycecil.itch.io/classics-patch">Serious Sam Classics Patch</a></li>

      <p>Slowed down the development of the patch for this year, mostly just fixing and improving upon what's already there. Download this year's last 1.9.4 version <a href="https://github.com/SamClassicPatch/SuperProject/releases/tag/1.9.4">here</a>.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/Serious-Engine">Serious Engine 1 fork</a></li>

      <p>Some more major changes, including but not limited to: SDL3 support that replaced SDL2, cross-platform OpenAL support that also restores EAX effects, multi-mice support, integer-based ticks that completely eliminate the slowdown bug. Not working on it anymore for the time being.</p>
      
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-ECC">Entity Class Compiler</a></li>

      <p>Ported some features from the enhanced configuration to the other compilers (1.10, 1.50 and SSR). Also made it buildable under Linux.</p>
      
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DreamyCecil/VDF">VDF reader and writer</a></li>

      <p>Made a public domain reader/writer library for the Valve Data Format as a personal exercise in C. I really like writing my own parsers of text formats for some reason.</p>

    </ul>

      <p>I suddenly began making art again and it was all thanks to Deltarune and its wonderful art community that I've got to know this year. You can check out all of my art this year <a href="/art#2025">in the gallery here</a>.</p>
